# Bot template for newbies

FIRST THING CHANGE ``main.js`` TO ``index.js``

welcome to the repository for discord.js bot making. 

There's not a lot to do, first thing you do is you put in your token in the main.js all the way below.
Then fill in your prefix in the config.json and you're literaly good to go!
Open the powershell window from the folder and do "node main.js"
It should be working and fine.
I also added some pre-commands. You can add/edit them as well

Commands: 
1. about: make an about command for your bot
2. help: a help command
3. meme: a meme command (maybe the most challenging)

I was able to do pre-built in Command Handeling, so you are welcome

Thanks to SoCuul #0001 for introducing me the code for this.

Enjoy, and if there are any questions/bugs just make an issue, and I'll try to fix it

thanks
