# Bot template for newbies
## **Welcome to the repository for discord.js bot making.** 

**Setup:**
There's not a lot to do, first thing you do is you put in your token in the ``index.js`` all the way below. Then fill in your prefix in the config.json and you're literaly good to go! 

**Hosting:**
Open the powershell window from the folder and do ``node index.js``. It should be working and fine.
I also created some pre-made commands. You can add/edit them as well.

**Commands:** (You can add your own) 
1. about: a customizable about command, where you can put detailed info about your bot.
2. help: a customizable help command, where you can put your commands, contact, etc.
3. meme: command where the bot will retrieve a hot post from r/memes and display it. 

Command Handeling is already done, so you're welcome ðŸ˜‰.

Thanks to SoCuul #0001 for the command handler, and bits of the code.

Enjoy, and if there are any questions/bugs just make an issue, and I'll try to fix it

Have fun!
